# We need a way to allow groups and host modules to override variables from other
# low precedence groups, or to extend a dictionary, list or some other object defined
# previously. How do we accomplish this?
#
# One approach that I tried was to implement a fully hierarchical lookup for the
# host module that did go through all groups in reverse order of precedence and return the
# as soon as a variable was defined on one of the modules. Apart from the complexity,
# a problem with this approach was that modifying existing variables like dictionaries from
# parent modules wasn't easy or clean. We would've had to distinguish between those cases
# depending on a type annotation of the variable. While this was possible, it introduced
# an unnecessary conecept of annotating some variables to gain special "magic" behavior
# and a lot of complexity. At that time, the depndencies between modules was defined in
# the modules themselves, which made it impossible to inherit variables between groups.
#
# The approach I settled on now is to define groups and group dependencies in the inventory,
# allowing us to load group modules in the correct order. By doing this, we can bequest (copy)
# all variables that have been defined until that point to the next module that will be loaded,
# be it a host or another group. This allows any module to access and modify all inherited
# variables easily, as they are just part of the global variables.
#
# This reduces the special "fora" behavior to this list of things:
#   - script parameters are defined via a "params" dataclass
#   - all attributes are defined on the host in question, but script default variables
#     still require minimal hijacking of getattr
#   - inventories, groups and hosts are collections of global variables used within fora
