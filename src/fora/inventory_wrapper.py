    determined by the `url` is responsible to parse it and provides a hostname.
    This means that both of the urls `localhost` and `ssh://root@localhost:22` will
    result in a host named `localhost` by default.

    Beware that hostname extraction naturally needs to occurr before the corresponding
    host module is loaded. The module can theoretically overwrite its intially assigned
    `url` or even specify an explicit connector implementation, which can never be used
    to assign a different name to the host in retrospect. Therefore, specifying the final

    A common use-case is to define key properties of the host directly in the inventory.
    Example: You have 10 virtual machines with similar network configuration - just the MAC
    and IP addresses differ. A group `vm-instances` is used to define the network configuration,
    but it should have easy access to these central variables. Defining a variable in
    the host module is too late, and will not be visible in the group definition,
    and a global dictionary indexed by hostname is cumbersome and could be considered a
    bad practice because defining a host-specific variable in a group is unclean.
    By utilizing the host's `vars` dict in the inventory, the variables will be visible
    in the group and will also be cleanly defined.

    # We need a way to allow groups and host modules to override variables from other

    # One approach that I tried was to implement a fully hierarchical lookup for the
    # host module that did go through all groups in reverse order of precedence and return the
    # as soon as a variable was defined on one of the modules. Apart from the complexity,
    # a problem with this approach was that modifying existing variables like dictionaries from
    # parent modules wasn't easy or clean. We would've had to distinguish between those cases
    # depending on a type annotation of the variable. While this was possible, it introduced
    # an unnecessary conecept of annotating some variables to gain special "magic" behavior
    # and a lot of complexity. At that time, the depndencies between modules was defined in
    # the modules themselves, which made it impossible to inherit variables between groups.
    #
    # The approach I settled on now is to define groups and group dependencies in the inventory,
    # allowing us to load group modules in the correct order for each host. By doing this, we can
    # bequest (copy) all variables that have been defined until that point to the next module that
    # will be loaded, be it a host or another group. This allows any module to access and modify
    # all inherited variables easily, as they are just part of the global variables.

        This function instanciates the given host by recursively loading all groups
        in the correct topological order and propagating variables until finally the
        host module is instanciated.

        Different hosts don't share group instanciations, as the groups may modify
        variables from previously loaded groups (e.g. add to dictionaries). As two
        different hosts can share just a single group out of many, and because groups
        need to modify global state in-place, we cannot reuse a group instanciated for
        another host.

        This loader asserts that a group doesn't redefine (as in completely overwrite)
        an existing variable, when this group doesn't have a dependency on the group
        from where the instanciation is overwritten. This prevents ambiguous definitions
        caused by the two groups having arbitrary relative ordering. Although this does
        assume that a group only modifies existing variables by adding information
        (e.g. appending to list or adding keys to a dict) instead of removing information.
