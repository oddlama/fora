# simple_automation

An ansible-inspired infrastructure and configuration management tool, but with a focus on minimalism and simplicity.
Intended uses are small-scale machine administation, system configuration tracking, or even just dotfiles management.

The main features are:

* Simple, not complex.
* Almost self-contained, except for jinja2 for templating.
* Minimal. This library consists of only ~1000 LOC.
* Supports encrypted variable storage.
* Executes commands over a single ssh connection (â†’ fast execution)
* Concicse, readable output (and optionally more verbose but still compact)
* Easily keep track of your system's state by automatically committing changed files to a git repository.
* Use python to write your configuration and don't be limited by a domain specific language.
* Uses a single ssh connection per host.

Drawbacks:

* Currently for simplicity there is no way to become a privileged user on a host.
  That means if you want to do things as root on a machine, you need an ssh connection for the root user.

## Minimal Example (Tracking only)

## Good to know

* Tasks have an implicit enabled variable
* Context defaults. Best practice: Always set them yourself.
  context.defaults(user="root", umask=0o077, dir_mode=0o700, file_mode=0o600,
                   owner="root", group="root")
* Writing your own transactions.
* Which transactions are already avaiable?
* Your tracking repo must already have a commit!
* Manage packages on hosts with different distributions
* Conditionals based on transaction results
* Using vault variables
* Check if host is in group
* Only track a directory without doing anything else. Useful for externally modified directories,
  or even to use this just for system tracking.
* Variable inheritance order
* Special jinja2 variables (simple_automation_managed, context)
* Secrets: Don't put secrets where they are printed. Ideally only in templated files, then you are safe.
